      <description>Re-tros, or their full name, Rebuilding the Rights of Statues, is a band from Beijing, China which has three members, Hua Dong, Liu Ming and Huang Jin. They were a post punk band but now they are more experimental and trying to add more elements into their songs.
I found this band on Youtube first in 2020. Thanks to a top-rated music Variety Show called &amp;ldquo;The Big Band&amp;rdquo; that Re-tros was on it as well, Youtube recommend one of their live show to me.</description>
