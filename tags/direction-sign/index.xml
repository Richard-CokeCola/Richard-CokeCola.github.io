      <description>Re-tros, or their full name, Rebuilding the Rights of Statues, is a band from Beijing, China, with three members, Hua Dong, Liu Ming, and Huang Jin. They were a post-punk band, but now they are more experimental and adding more elements to their songs. Their kind of wired band name came from all three members. Each of them came up with one word then assembled them into one sentence. The lead singer, keyboard and guiter player, Hua Dong gave the word &amp;ldquo;the right&amp;rdquo; because he thinks this is very important for him.</description>
