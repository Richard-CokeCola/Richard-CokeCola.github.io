      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;1&#34;&gt;1 &lt;a href=&#34;#1&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a very late night or you can say it was a very early morning, beautiful stars on the sky,  a very ugly baby boy was born with four deep wrinkles on the forehead. &amp;ldquo;Looks like a monster&amp;rdquo;, my father describes so. &amp;ldquo;In fact, I was too scared to hold you when that nurse hand you to me&amp;rdquo;, my father usually adds this also, &amp;ldquo;so I took some steps backwards&amp;rdquo;. My grandmother was also there, she says, I was black and long, looks like a old man. When the nurse took me to bath, she stands beside the nurses worried they may confused me with other kids. &amp;ldquo;Relax&amp;rdquo;, the nurse said with smile, &amp;ldquo;this kid won&amp;rsquo;t be confused&amp;rdquo;. My mother remembered that the women next bed to her gave birth to a baby girl. &amp;ldquo;Here little arms and legs were so cute, just like the angel&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
