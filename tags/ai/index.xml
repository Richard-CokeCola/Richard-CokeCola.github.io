      <description>Install Nvidia driver on Ubuntu can be very tricky. Sometimes it goes extremely smooth while sometime it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. Follow these following steps, it should make it easier.
  Download Nvidia driver to your Ubuntu machine from its website. It is a .run file.
  Install make and gcc.
sudo apt install make sudo apt install gcc   Disable Nouveau kernel driver.
# Create a file sudo nano /etc/modprobe.</description>

      <description>Why virtual environment is needed? It is very common in deep learning that each project has different dependency requirements, which makes environment management important. Conda can help us set multiple virtual environments and keep them independent from each other. Thus, all of your ML projects can run smoothly.
Set up virtual environment for pytorch using conda   Install CUDA and cuDNN
This step is only necessary for those who has a GPU.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s the goal? To run YOLOv5 on jetson developer kit to achieve real-time object detection. The following instructions has been tested on: Jetson nano Jetson Xavier NX What you need: A Jetson nano (If you are using other Jetson developer kit from Nvidia, I am sure you can take this as reference as well.) A SD card and power suply which meets the needs. Another computer or laptop with internet</description>
