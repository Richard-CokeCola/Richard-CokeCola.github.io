## 1	Introduction

Re-tros, or their full name, Rebuilding the Rights of Statues, is a band from Beijing, China, with three members, Hua Dong, Liu Ming, and Huang Jin. They were a post-punk band, but now they are more experimental and adding more elements to their songs.  

I found this band on Youtube first in 2020. Thanks to a top-rated music Variety Show called "The Big Band" that Re-tros was on it as well, Youtube recommend one of their live show to me. After watching just one of their video, I was digging into their mysterious lyrics, creepy melody, unique vibe, perfect-matched vocal, and everything about them. 

### 1.1	Band Name

Their kind of wired band name came from all three members. They all agreed not to have a short band name. After struggling to think of a good band name after a long time, they figured out an approach to come up with the band's name. Each of them came up with one word then assembled them into one sentence. The lead singer, keyboard and guitar player, Hua Dong, gave the word "the right" because he thinks this is very important. Their former drummer Ma Hui choose the word "Statues". From his point of view, the statues are a representation of eternity. On the other hand, it also shows absurdity. When great change occurs, people tend to destroy the statues. For example, after Vladimir Lenin died, lots of his statues were destroyed in east European countries. The lead singer, bassist, keyboard player, Liu Ming, gave the word "Rebuilding" because she wants to make a different band than her former and other bands in China.

### 3.1	My music taste before I start listening Re-tros

The first thing that attracts me is the massive difference between their music and those I listened to before. The genre I usually listen to include pop, classical and folk. The first band I ever listen called BLUE. I have no idea why they named their band BLUE, but because of them, my favourite colour before middle school was always blue. Some other bands and singers I like including Linkin Park, Backstreet Boys, Avril Lavigne, Jay Chou, Massive Attack, Li Zhi, Luo DaYou, Adele, Tayor Swift, Asaf Avidan and Wu Tiao Ren. In addition, I like Clair de Lune by Debussy very much. However, Re-tros' songs are not like any of those. For instance, I cannot put their latest album, Before the Applause, into any genre I am aware of.
