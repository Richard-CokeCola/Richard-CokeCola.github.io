# 1

It was a very late night or you can say it was a very early morning, beautiful stars on the sky,  a very ugly baby boy was born with four deep wrinkles on the forehead. "Looks like a monster", my father describes so. "In fact, I was too scared to hold you when that nurse hand you to me", my father usually adds this also, "so I took some steps backwards". My grandmother was also there, she says, I was black and long, looks like a old man. When the nurse took me to bath, she stands beside the nurses worried they may confused me with other kids. "Relax", the nurse said with smile, "this kid won't be confused". My mother remembered that the women next bed to her gave birth to a baby girl. "Here little arms and legs were so cute, just like the angel".
