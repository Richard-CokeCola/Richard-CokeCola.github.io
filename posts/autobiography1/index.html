My grandmother was also there, she says, I was black and long, looks like a old man. When the nurse took me to bath, she stands beside the nurses worried they may confused me with other kids. &ldquo;Relax&rdquo;, the nurse said with smile, &ldquo;this kid won&rsquo;t be confused&rdquo;. My mother remembered that the women next bed to her gave birth to a baby girl. &ldquo;Here little arms and legs were so cute, just like the angel&rdquo;.">
